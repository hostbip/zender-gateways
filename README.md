# Pricing

The custom gateway system only supports sending function, you can also specify pricing of each sent sms by country which will be deducted from user credits. It will use the currency you selected in the system settings.

**default** - The default price for each sms, if the country of recipient is not listed in **countries** array then default price will be used for credit deduction.

**countries** - The array of countries with unique pricing, if you want to charge more for sending to specific country, you can do it here. Please note that country codes must be in **ISO Alpha-2** format. Prices supports float values ie..,, 0.002, 0.01 and so on.

Please strictly follow this format:
```yaml
{
  "default": "0.01",
  "countries": {
    "us": "0.01",
    "ph": "0.1",
    "gb": "0.02"
  }
}
```
